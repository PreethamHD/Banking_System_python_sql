The banking system project  was created with MySQL and Python demonstrates a reliable and approachable program for handling crucial banking functions. The system has a safe login process that guarantees authorized access. It also smoothly moves users to an extensive services window where they can carry out important tasks like making deposits and withdrawals, checking their balances, changing their passwords, and canceling accounts

Firstly a login window is created which takes account number and password and if correct logins to the bank

This project can easily be used to get a basic understanding of python based GUI tkinter and customtkinter with backend sql database connectivity, as a beginner this project really illustrates how to work with gui and database, can learn this and then experiment, learn and make still more complex and advanced projects.
